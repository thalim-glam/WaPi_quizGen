# WApi_QuizGen

## Description

This is the third homework for the coding boodcamp which is to write JavaScript code for a password generator. 
- The name of my homework means "Password Generator" in different languages :D
- My motivation was to learn JavaScript. And doing this project helped me a lot!
- This project helped me to learn more about how to use loops and functions in JS. 

## Task (Optional)

This week's Challenge requires me to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they select. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Installation

All the installations where there as I already did few homeworks and prework.

## Usage

Please go to this link to view my 03-homework : https://thalim-glam.github.io/Parola_rafall/

Here is a sample screenshot showing partial view og my project

## Comand line code

I used a lot of git commands like :
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "Comment goes here"
git branch
git push
git pull origin main
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/add-branch

## Credits

Apart from me :D the credit also goes to my Instructor, TAs, Tutor, Classmates, and GOOGLE (my best buddy to help whenever I got stuck in anything!)
For Password help this link was helpful [list of password special characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Features

In my code I had 1 main branch and crated a few featured branch to test my code and update.
  - I did not change much in HTML / CSS files.
  - Added the screenshot and 
  - Mostly updated the script.js file in the started code.
  - Used console.log and inspect to debug my work

## How to Contribute

I followed this https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide as my guidelines to how to write a README file.
I also did tutoring session to understand the homework better.
The TAs were very supportive and guided me a lot.

## Tests

To test the homework, 
  - Please go to the deployed website 
  - Click the generate passwork button
  - Test different cases
  - You can check the "Console" to see some of my checking messages.
  - I have put a few comments inside the javascript code as well.
